## Overview
The Cat vs. Dog Classifier is a web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either a cat or a dog. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to upload images and receive instant predictions based on a trained model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Git & GitHub

## Features
- User can upload images of cats or dogs.
- The model classifies the uploaded image as either "Cat" or "Dog."
- Displays the prediction result along with the uploaded image.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmerSalimKhan/cat-vs-dog-classifier-cnn.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-classifier-cnn
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Install the libraries in Requirement.txt "pip install -r requirements.txt"

3. **Run the application**
   python app.py

## Note: The accuracy of the model is around 88% but the model is showing some poor performance with cat images.
